# Linear Regression

#### Hello World Example

The classic example of Linear Regression is to predict housing prices given some labeled data.

#### How does it work?

Think `y = mx + b`

`y = output`
`m = slope`
`b = constant`

##### Note that:
Remember that by definition, simple linear regression has a single independent variable and a single dependent variable

As your data becomes more complex you will have more independent variables (features) and you will need to use [Multilinear Regression](https://github.com/jimmychimmyy).

#### Assumptions of Linear Regression

Linear Regression makes five key assumptions about your data:
1. Linear relationship
2. Multivariate normality (are your variables distributed normally?)
3. Little to no multicollinearity (multicollinearity occurs when the independent variables are too highly correlated with each other)
4. No Auto-Correlation
5. Homoscedasticity
