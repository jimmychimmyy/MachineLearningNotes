# Artificial Neural Network
#### Hello, Artificial Neural Network
Artifical neural networks (ANN) are machine learning models inspired by biological neural networks. ANNs are

#### How does it work?

In this section I will be discussing the most common model of an ANN: the 3 layer fully connected backpropogation model.

From a a top-down perspective, this ANN has 3 layers: the input layer, the output layer, and the hidden layer. All ANNs follow this structure however they may have more than a single hidden layer. In each layer, there is some number of nodes which are all connected by edges to every single node in the previous and subsequent layer.

Each node has value of [0.0, 1.0] where 0 represents "off" and 1 represents "on". The 

###### How do we select the number of nodes in each layer?
The number of nodes in the input layer is determined by the number of features in your feature vector.
