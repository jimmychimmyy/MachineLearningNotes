# Logistic Regression

#### Hello, Logistic Regression
Contrary to its name, logistic regression is actually a classification algorithm. Logistic regression transforms its input using the sigmoid function (a.k.a the logistic function) to produce probability values as output. These resulting probability values are used to sort instances into discrete classes based on some user-supplied threshold.

#### What is an Activation Function?

An activation function checks if our output is above a certain decision threshold, if so, our model will classify the instance as true.

For example, if we set our decision threshold to be 0.5, then any instance with 0.5 or greater probability will be classified as true and any less than 0.5 as false.
