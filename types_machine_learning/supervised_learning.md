# What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised Learning is the most commonly used form of machine learning. You must labeled data: data which has a target variable (y). A supervised learning model learns the relationship between dependent variables (X) and map them to the output target variable (y).

#### Hello World Example

The classic example for supervised learning is to classify images of handwritten digits using the MNIST database. These handwritten digits are individually labeled so we know exactly what digit each image corresponds to.
